# CNN_GeomClass
Geometrical shape classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project contains models trained to classify images of geometrical shapes into 5 classes:
- cube
- sphere
- pyramid
- cone
- cylinder

Provided is code of all models as well as the datasets used for training, validation and testing.

Resources used/needed:
 - Python 3.9
 - Tensorflow 2.8
 - Anaconda 3 (virtual environment)
 - CUDA drivers (if using GPU), otherwise Google Colab
 - PyCharm 2024.2
